## The assignment

Download this repo and run this project locally. Validate the local HTML with the [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) (you can use the **Validate by Direct Input** option to copy and paste your HTML into this area). Fix all issues in the index.html. 

Tip: do this step by step and re-validate the code again; sometimes multiple errors disappear when fixing 1 line.

Make sure that this edited website has no errors or warnings anymore. 

## Submitting your work
Create a new branch called **gh-pages** and upload your local work into this branch.
Start a new **pull request**, select **one** reviewer and make sure to put the (working) **GitHub Pages URL** in the comment section. Do **not** merge this Pull Request yourself. That's up to the reviewer to decide (merging is approving the assignment).
